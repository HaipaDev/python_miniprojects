# python_miniprojects
Bunch of miniprojects as a sidetrack from the [bootcamp](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/python_100day_bootcamp) around day 15+

First thing I did was upgrade [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) as I wanted a very quick way of downloading stuff and wanted to practice my basic Python skills
I have some unfinished stuff for a 2.0 script of YT-DLP but I left it for now

Then I also made a bit more easy video manipulation mini programs
But its all very basic, pure terminal stuff

I definitely want to try compiling it all into a GUI combining all of the programs in the future after learning Tkinter
